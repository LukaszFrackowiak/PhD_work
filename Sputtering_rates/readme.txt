Sputtering rate by Łukasz Frąckowiak

OOP source code of program to adjust power supply of targets during alloy sputtering in co-sputtering magnetron devices with two targets.

Class sample create object that contain information about sputtering alloy. After that it calculate power needed to obtain desire sample.
Additional file needed:
molecular_database.xlsx contains values of molecular volumes for elements.
sputterung_parameter_10(15).xlsx contains function parameters to properly calculate powers. Files are obtained by using sputtering_callibration software 


Class app_window create GUI object using tkinter package.
